    * No more domain.py nor abstract.py: They've been moved to plugin.py
        where they belong.
    * plugin.py: Filter.instances to method instead of property due to
        context being passed as argument to Filter.process instead
        of as argument to constructor.
    * plugin.py: Filter.instances to publish.plugin.instances due to it
        not being applicable to Selector and Selector being subclass
        of Filter.
